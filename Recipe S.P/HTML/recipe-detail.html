            <h3 class="recipe-title">Spaghetti Carbonara</h3>
            <p class="recipe-description">A creamy, delicious classic Italian pasta dish with eggs, cheese, pancetta, and pepper.</p>
            <h4>Here’s a classic recipe for <strong>Spaghetti Carbonara</strong>:</h4>

            <h5>Ingredients:</h5>
            <ul>
                <li>400g spaghetti</li>
                <li>150g pancetta or guanciale (Italian cured pork cheek), diced</li>
                <li>4 large eggs</li>
                <li>100g Pecorino Romano cheese, grated</li>
                <li>50g Parmesan cheese, grated</li>
                <li>2 cloves garlic, peeled (optional)</li>
                <li>Freshly ground black pepper</li>
                <li>Salt (for pasta water)</li>
            </ul>
        
            <h5>Instructions:</h5>
            <ol>
                <li><strong>Prepare the pasta:</strong>
                    <p>Bring a large pot of salted water to a boil. Add the spaghetti and cook according to the package instructions until al dente. Reserve about 1 cup of pasta cooking water before draining.</p>
                </li>
                <li><strong>Cook the pancetta/guanciale:</strong>
                    <p>While the pasta is cooking, heat a large pan over medium heat. Add the diced pancetta or guanciale and cook until crispy, about 5–7 minutes. If using garlic, add the garlic cloves to the pan for flavor, and remove them once they turn golden.</p>
                </li>
                <li><strong>Make the egg mixture:</strong>
                    <p>In a bowl, whisk together the eggs, Pecorino Romano, and Parmesan cheese until smooth. Season with freshly ground black pepper (generously for flavor).</p>
                </li>
                <li><strong>Combine pasta and pancetta:</strong>
                    <p>Once the pasta is done, add it directly to the pan with the pancetta (off the heat to avoid scrambling the eggs). Toss the pasta to coat it in the rendered fat from the pancetta.</p>
                </li>
                <li><strong>Add the egg mixture:</strong>
                    <p>Quickly pour the egg and cheese mixture over the pasta, tossing vigorously to combine. The residual heat from the pasta will cook the eggs, creating a creamy sauce. If the mixture is too thick, add some reserved pasta cooking water a little at a time until you reach a creamy consistency.</p>
                </li>
                <li><strong>Serve:</strong>
                    <p>Serve the Spaghetti Carbonara immediately, topped with more freshly ground black pepper and extra grated cheese if desired.</p>
                </li>

            <li>1 large onion, finely chopped</li>
            <li>2 cloves garlic, minced</li>
            <li>1-inch piece of ginger, grated</li>
            <li>1 can (400g) diced tomatoes</li>
            <li>1 tablespoon ground cumin</li>
            <li>1 tablespoon ground coriander</li>
            <li>1 tablespoon garam masala</li>
            <li>1 teaspoon chili powder</li>

            <li>Fresh cilantro leaves, for garnish</li>
            <li>Salt to taste</li>
        </ul>
    
        <h5>Instructions:</h5>
        <ol>
            <li><strong>Marinate the chicken:</strong>
                <p>In a large bowl, combine the chicken, yogurt, lemon juice, cumin, coriander, garam masala, turmeric, chili powder, ginger, garlic, and salt. Mix well, ensuring the chicken is fully coated. Cover and refrigerate for at least 1 hour, preferably overnight.</p>
            </li>
            <li><strong>Cook the chicken:</strong>
                <p>Preheat your grill or oven to medium-high heat. Thread the marinated chicken onto skewers (if grilling) or spread the chicken on a baking tray. Cook for about 10-15 minutes until the chicken is cooked through and slightly charred. Alternatively, you can cook the chicken in a hot pan with a little oil until golden brown.</p>
            </li>
            <li><strong>Prepare the gravy:</strong>
                <p>Heat the oil or ghee in a large pan over medium heat. Add the chopped onion and sauté until softened and golden, about 5-7 minutes. Add the garlic and ginger, and cook for another minute until fragrant.</p>
            </li>
            <li><strong>Make the sauce:</strong>
                <p>Add the diced tomatoes, cumin, coriander, garam masala, chili powder, turmeric, and cinnamon. Stir and cook for about 5-7 minutes until the tomatoes break down and the spices become fragrant.</p>
            </li>
            <li><strong>Add the cream:</strong>
                <p>Reduce the heat and stir in the heavy cream. Simmer for another 5 minutes to allow the sauce to thicken and become creamy. Season with salt to taste.</p>
            </li>
            <li><strong>Combine chicken and sauce:</strong>
                <p>Add the cooked chicken to the sauce and stir well to coat the chicken in the gravy. Simmer for another 10-15 minutes, allowing the flavors to meld together.</p>
            </li>
            <li><strong>Serve:</strong>
                <p>Serve the Chicken Tikka Masala hot, garnished with fresh cilantro leaves. It pairs wonderfully with steamed basmati rice or naan bread.</p>
            </li>

        <h4>Here’s a simple and delicious recipe for <strong>Avocado Toast</strong>:</h4>

        <ul>
            <li>2 ripe avocados</li>

            <li><strong>Serve:</strong>
                <p>Serve the avocado toast immediately while the bread is warm and crispy. Enjoy it as a quick breakfast, brunch, or snack!</p>
